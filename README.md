This is just a fork/mirror of bw_plex, snapshot taken 4/16/2019

This repo also contains a bash script (why do I ever write anything in bash?) which I use to invoke bw_plex directly against mp4 files within a folder and then copy them to a subfolder named "introremoved".

Without getting into the bw_plex code, I couldn't improve the results or use the advanced (and super cool) features of bw_plex; However it worked very well for me (SG1 episodes).

You must also change the hardcoded values for the length of the intro sequence (which in my case was around 57-60 seconds). Specifically the time from the first block of all black that preceeds the intro and the one that follows the intro. If no such blackness exists, the script should fall back on existing bw_plex logic which ought (one would suppose) to use the audio silence blocks (assuming those exist) that buffer the intro but I couldn't get any of the cool audiofingerprinting or ocr'ing to work without plex (without hacking the code, which I fully intend to do one day).

The bash script is named removeintro (and is a bash file with no extension)

## How it works:

Bw_plex listens for playing events using websocket. We download the first 10 minutes of that episode and/or the theme music from YouTube/tvtunes/Plex.

We then create a audio print from the theme song that we match against the audio of the 10 minutes of the episode. (Thereâ€™s a backup method that uses audio silence in combination with black frames too).

We then check if this episode has a recap using subtitles and audio where we look for clues like last season, previously on (add you own words in the config).

Download the last part of the episode an and indentify the start and end of the outro.

Depending on your settings we will then allow playback until the theme start or just jump straight to intro end if we also should skip recaps.

Since this is a rather slow process we also start processing the next episode so next time you watch the same show we instantly seek the client to the end of the theme.
